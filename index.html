    <h2>Baptism and Concupiscence</h2>
    <p>Baptism takes away Original Sin, but not concupiscence.</p>
    <p><strong>Why Doesn’t Baptism take away concupiscence?</strong></p>
    <p>Christian life involves an ongoing struggle against sin and temptation. Concupiscence represents one aspect of this struggle. While baptism initiates a person into the life of grace through justification, it doesn't mean that they are suddenly immune to the effects of sin or temptation. Instead, it marks the beginning of a lifelong journey of growth in holiness and continual conversion. Through baptism, Catholics receive God’s grace, which helps them resist sin and grow in holiness. However, overcoming concupiscence requires ongoing effort and cooperation with God's grace. It's a process of continually choosing to align one's will with God's and resisting the temptations that arise from concupiscence.</p>

    <h2>Sin</h2>
    <p><strong>Sin is an offense against:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reason</li>
        <li>Truth</li>
        <li>Right conscience</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Copying and pasting from ChatGPT for an English essay and claiming that it is your own work.</p>
